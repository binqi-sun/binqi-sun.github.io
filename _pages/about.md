I am currently a Ph.D. student at Chair of Cyber Physical Systems in Production Engineering, Technical University of Munich ([TUM](https://www.tum.de/en)), advised by [Marco Caccamo](https://rtsl.cps.mw.tum.de/personal_page/mcaccamo/). During the fourth year of my Ph.D., I am also a visiting researcher with [Tarek Abdelzaher](https://abdelzaher.cs.illinois.edu/) at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign ([UIUC](https://illinois.edu/)). Before I started my Ph.D., I obtained my master's degree from Department of Automation, [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), advised by [Ling Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lC7bVMwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

My research interests include optimization, scheduling, and machine learning. My Ph.D. research focuses on the intersection of real-time (RT) systems and machine learning (ML). Related research topics include real-time deep neural network inference (RT for ML) and machine learning based real-time system design (ML for RT). My previous research is related to combinatorial optimization and smart manufacturing.

Please feel free to send me an email if you are interested in my research and want to discuss relevant research topics or potential collaborations.
